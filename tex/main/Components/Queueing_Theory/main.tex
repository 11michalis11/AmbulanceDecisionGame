\section{Queuing Theory component}

% The waiting times are functions dependent to the service rate (\(\mu\)), the arrival rate (\(\lambda\)) and the hospital's capacity. Thus, for every instance of the routing game (i.e. for every different value of \(p_1\) and \(p_2\)) a new waiting time value will be calculated. The mean waiting time in the queue for an \(M|M|c\) system is defined as:
